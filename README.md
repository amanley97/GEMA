# gEMA (gem5 External Modules API)

## Overview

gEMA (**g**em5 **E**xternal **M**odules **A**PI) is a flexible and powerful API designed to allow external programs to integrate and manage gem5 simulations. Building upon the gem5 standard library, it simplifies the configuration, execution, and management of simulations by providing an easy-to-use standard HTTP interface. Through various endpoints, gEMA allows external programs to interact with gem5 to  retrieve configuration options, configure simulation parameters, start simulations, and more.
